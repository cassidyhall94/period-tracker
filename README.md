Period Tracker
With a deep passion for empowering individuals and safeguarding women's rights, I am working on a unique project to develop an intuitive app for menstrual cycle tracking. In light of recent challenges to women's rights, particularly the revocation of the Roe v. Wade decision, I believe it is crucial to provide people with control over their data, ensuring it cannot be tracked or sold to companies.

The primary objective of this project is to create a secure and private platform where users can effortlessly monitor their menstrual cycles while preserving their privacy. By prioritising data ownership and protection, I am designing an app that allows users to have full authority over their personal information, preventing any unauthorised access or misuse.

The app will offer a user-friendly interface, enabling seamless tracking of period start and end dates. Additionally, it will provide helpful reminders two days prior to the expected start of each period, as well as predictive features based on individual user data, empowering users with insights into their future cycle start dates.

In these uncertain times, it is crucial to support personal agency and privacy. Through this project, I aim to contribute to these discussions by providing a valuable resource that empowers individuals to make informed decisions about their reproductive health.

By combining user-centric design, cutting-edge technology, and a commitment to privacy, my project strives to make a positive impact, helping users reclaim control over their menstrual cycle tracking and emphasising the importance of data ownership and personal autonomy.
